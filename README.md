# Linked_Lists_Method_Library
A library with functions for using a linked list, sorted by a string.


This repo is a implementation of linked list functions. It represents the start of a new project of mine.

main.c simply presents the functionality of the library.
You can use the library with any data type. A struct is recomended.
